# Exploring Experiences with Automated Program Repair in Practice (ICSE'24)
**Paper Abstract:**
Automated Program Repair, also known as APR, is an approach for automatically repairing software faults. There is a large amount of research on automated program repair, but very little offers in-depth insights into how practitioners think about and employ APR in practice. To learn more about practitioners' perspectives and experiences with current APR tools and techniques, we administered a survey, which received valid responses from 331 software practitioners. We analyzed survey responses to gain insights regarding factors that correlate with APR awareness, experience, and use. We established a strong correlation between APR awareness and tool use and attributes including job position, company size, total coding experience, and preferred language of software practitioners. We also found that practitioners are using other forms of support, such as co-workers and ChatGPT, more frequently than APR tools when fixing software defects. We learned about the drawbacks that practitioners encounter while utilizing the existing APR tools and the impact that each drawback has on their practice. Our findings provide implications for research and practice centered on adoption and use of APR.

To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the survey design and questions, and to illustrate the correlations that have been established through the responses, we have attached our survey questions herewith (survey.pdf). We have discovered some intriguing findings through the analysis of our survey. Significant correlations were observed between APR awareness and a variety of factors, encompassing preferred programming language, job function, company size, and overall coding experience. Overall, developers have a greater understanding of APR than managers. Employees of small businesses (less than 100 employees) are also more likely to be knowledgeable about APR than those of medium or large organizations, according to our findings. A greater proportion of practitioners with over five years of comprehensive coding experience are knowledgeable about APR. Lastly, APR awareness is more prevalent among developers who favor Java over Python and Javascript, as well as C++ over Javascript.
In lieu of automated program maintenance, the majority of respondents indicated a preference for human support from their own organization or another team within their own company when resolving issues or bugs. While respondents acknowledge frequent usage of APR tools, they also express a preference for alternative support platforms, including Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and GitHub.
The respondents were most apprehensive about overlooking any rare or unusual behavior; developers were more concerned about this than managers and QA specialists. Regular verification and high maintenance costs are the primary concerns of both QA specialists and managers. Additionally, QA specialists are concerned about overlooking rare or uncommon behavior. As opposed to automatically fixing defects, APR tools that offer recommendations for numerous potential solutions are preferred by practitioners. In addition, practitioners desire user-friendly interfaces that offer support and warnings or notifications for any potential modifications and facilitate the repair procedure.
